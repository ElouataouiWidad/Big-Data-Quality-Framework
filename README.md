# Big-Data-Quality-Framework

This repository contains the core code of a big data quality framework that assess 12 Metrics Namely: Completeness, Timeliness, Volatility, Uniqueness, Conformity, Consistency, Ease of manipulation, Relevancy, Readability, Security, Accessibility, and Integrity. These metrics are grouped into 5 quality aspects which are: Validity, Reliability, Availability, Usability, and Pertinence. For more reliable data quality assessment, this framework allows measuring a weighted big data quality score by applying data weights at different levels of data units: 
•	Data Fields: the data attributes are not equally important and thus should have different weights when measuring a quality metric
•	Quality Dimensions: the quality metrics are not equally important and thus should have different weights when measuring a quality aspect
•	Quality Aspects: the quality aspects are not equally important and thus should have different weights when measuring the global quality score
